# Movie-Map(Stage-2)

This app is made as a part of Udacity [Android Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

This project is just the continuation of [Movie-Map](https://github.com/suvojitd79/Movie-Map)


## Objective
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1.

## Core features

* Presenting the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allowing the user to change sort order via a setting:
* The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allowing the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
* original title
* movie poster image thumbnail
* A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
* user rating (called vote_average in the api)
* release date

## New features
* users can view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* users can read reviews of a selected movie.
* users can mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star).
* used Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust an * efficient application.
* created a database using Room to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
* modified the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

## Additional features
* movie recommendations functionality is included 



### Getting Started

* Copy your own api key in string.xml(```app->src->main->res->values->string.xml```)

```
<resources>
    <string name="api_key">paste your key here</string>
</resources>
```

## Built with
